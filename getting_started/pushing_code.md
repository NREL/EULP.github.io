Pushing code
------------
Once you have made all your code updates and all the previous tasks have been run and are passing, you are then ready to push all your commits to the remote repository. In general, [commit messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) should be concise yet descriptive.

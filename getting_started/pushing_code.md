# Pushing code

Once you have made all your code updates and all the previous tasks have been run and are passing, you are then ready to push all your commits to the remote repository. In general, [commit messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) should be concise yet descriptive.

Having all your tests pass locally is not required to push all your commits to the remote repository. In general, however, if your tests are failing locally then you can expect them to fail remotely. The [Continuous integration](../continuous_integration/continuous_integration.md) describes this continuous integration process on a remote GitHub Actions machine in more detail.

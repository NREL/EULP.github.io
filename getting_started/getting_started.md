# Getting started

Once you have become familiar with Git and GitHub, you are then ready to start contributing to the repositories. The following instructions are for using Git from the command line, although there exist alternative applications for using Git and GitHub (e.g., [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)).

Keep in mind that your code does not need to be in perfect shape in order to commit and subversion it within the repositories. In fact, subversioning your files sooner rather than later is a good thing, as it will help to:
* Back up your code on a remote server
* Track future development on your code
* Let others view your development progress
* Test your code and identify next steps

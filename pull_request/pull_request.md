Pull request
------------
Once you have finished your code updates and are ready to have your changes merged into the main code base, you can then create a pull request (if you have not done so already). Assign the appropriate "Assignees" (e.g., you), "Reviewers", "Labels", etc. to the pull request. You are able to merge your branch into master once you have:
* Addressed all checklist items in the pre-populated pull request template
* Ensured you are up-to-date with the master branch
* Checked that your building is passing on `CircleCI`
* Confirmed that you have at least one pull request approval

Be sure to delete your branch after it has been merged.

As a note, every time a commit is made to the master branch the API documentation will be built. See the master branch's API documentation by clicking on the link located in the repository's README file.

Overview
--------

The [EULP repositories](https://github.com/NREL?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=EULP&type=&language=) store resources, and track history, for the End Use Load Profiles (EULP) project. The repositories are currently private, meaning that contents are not visible to everyone. Only members who have been invited to the EULP-RW team have write access (and therefore read access) to the repositories. Among other things, those with write access are permitted to pull and push contents from and to the repositories, respectively. Users wishing to contribute to the repositories should be familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the version control system software used to interact with GitHub. This [set of guides](https://guides.github.com/) provides helpful documentation and tutorials for installing and using Git, and for learning how GitHub works.

Storing our project on GitHub is important for the following reasons:
  * Files are stored remotely, and not just locally
  * EULP-RW team members can access/run everything contained in the repository
  * Development is tracked and managed (i.e., subversioned)
  * Code changes are first reviewed before they are merged into the main code base
